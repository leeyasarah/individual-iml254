<h1><font color="black">Career Goals:</font></h1>
<h2><font color=#5A6A73>My long-term goal is to open a cafe that brings together my love for art, cooking, and reading.
I envision the cafe as a warm, inviting space where guests can not only enjoy delicious food and coffee
but also experience a unique atmosphere filled with my personal art collection. Additionally, I want to create a cozy 
reading area within the cafe, offering visitors a quiet space to enjoy their favorite books, sip coffee, and relax. 
This cafe would be a true reflection of my passions, combining art, culinary tradition, and the love of reading
into one enriching experience. I also don’t want to put the café surrounding  the busy city because I think it might 
give noise pollution to my customers. I really hope that one day I will be able to achieve this.
